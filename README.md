Free financial data now! Use automatic downloader to download Choice data. For research use only~

# Choice version
We personally recommend to use `6.x` versions. We strongly recommend to replace the resources of screenshots of buttons by the one shown on your device.

# We provide a free Excel bypassing tool
Always opening an excel when files are saved? Let's use `EmptyPP.exe` to trick it!
```text
Idea: Because the Choice terminal will call the program to open xlsx by default to open the
      downloaded file after downloading the data, we only need to use an empty program and
      set it as the default program to open xlsx to avoid the problem of slow automatic download
      speed caused by the need to open the data file.
```

# We provide free data pre-processing tools
We provide a `R` processing tools that can automatically clear and sort the data.

We also provide a `MySQL` tool written in `Python` to automatically archive your data into your own database.
```text
Idea: Why not saving your data into a Rds or SQL file so you can easiyly retrieve the part
      you need next time?
```
